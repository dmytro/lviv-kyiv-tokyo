This is a short description of changes I'ver done to files of Ukrainian ispell.


Dictionary files
--------------------
All original dictionary files if modified by me are stored with 'dk' extension.
I.e. base.koi -> base.dk.  Coreected entrires are commented out with star (*) char as 
a first symbol of the string.

To make ne file for dictionary just do somthing like:

grep -v ^\* FILE.dk > FILE.koi

DO NOT EDIT *.koi file if *dk file is present. It WILL be overwritten

Affix file
----------

Do not edit  ukrainian.aff, edit ukrainian.aff.koi instead. *.aff file is 
overwriten with 'make'.
