Since soon after our first Linux-Mandrake release, we began receiving stories
and email from users of the distribution from all over the world. We created the mail adress <a href="mailto:happy@linux-mandrake.com">happy@linux-mandrake.com</a> so that users can describe how they enjoy runnig their computers with Mandrake and what they apreciate to do with it.<p>
We'd like to
share with you some of the creative and productive ways people are using
Linux-Mandrake in their own lives in this special section.

 Hello to you all.
 
 I want you to know that I am using Mandrake 6.0 and I love it.  I do not
 think that there is a "best" distribution, because everyone has
 different needs.  However, if there were a "best" distribution, Mandrake
 would get my vote.
 
 Thank you all very much.
 
 Regards

I just installed Mandrake 6.0 yesterday, and I must say, Thank you soooo
much! I can't believe the Linux4Win installation is as good as it is. It's
a lifesaver for people like me who can't live without their Windows
games, but also like using linux. Thanks again.

 How cute, you have your own "I'm so happy with Mandrake" address. 
 
 I am very happy with Mandrake. It is definitely worth the wait to upgrade
 Mandrake instead of dealing with all of the problems inherent with the
 RedHat distribution. Additonally, bringing bero on board was a good idea. I
 find that the distro runs very well with no surprises on my 3 desktops and
 two servers. I like it very much indeed. Please continue to focus on quality
 and stability.

Just what I need for a home computer system. Having all the RPMs there
on the disk has saved me a lot of time. I never expected to convert from
Slackware, but it's easier to make stuff work on Mandrake. I feel all
fluffy and warm inside.

Subject: <b>I LOVE IT!</b>
<hr>
I would like to voice my opinion regarding the Mandrake 6.0 distribution
and your Penguin's choice awards.

I LOVE IT!

I have tried Turbo Linux, Debian, Red Hat 5.2, and Slackware.  This was the
first time that I have seen an easy install that anyone with a little bit of
computer knowledge could breeze through and have a full blown internet server +
fully functional and stable "Windows" style operating system with all the
necessary apps to be productive as an Internet Server or an employee
Workstation.

The pricing was great too!  I used to grab Linux books just for the
distribution CDs (28.8 modems suck for ISOs), especially if your Windows XX box
does and can't get online.  For $26 I was able to get a full 3 cd set, an
installation manual, and answers to all my basic questions.

The online "list-serv" based support rocks.  I work for a major software
vendor, and know what it's like to have to deal with customers all day
long.  From what I have seen, they have some of the best people in the Linux
community monitoring their online support channels whether they are email,
news groups, or a web chat.  This shows me a company is interested in improving
their product and putting real dedication into what they do.   Many of the
answers and responses are even sent after the close of business, when most of us
Linux buffs are finally off the Microsoft machine and in our real environment.

On top of this, the X based live update is one feature Linux has needed for a
long time.  Surf over to a mirror and get the latest patches installed with a
click of a button.  With the open source and RPM model that this distribution
is built upon, it makes updating a piece of code with "undocumented features"
that might be causing problems much easier.

This brings up a major dilema.  Is Linux a desktop or server operating system? 
This is the first time I've really had to address this.  When looking at the
power + simplicity of Mandrake 6.0 (boot into a gui, etc), I would have to say
it could function as a desktop operating system.  (this email is being sent
from my secondary Mandrake Machine @ work).

Kudos to Mandrakesoft for a great product with all the right stuff..

Subject: <b>[FUN] better than RH!</b>

HI!
 I just finished installing Mandrake on my box and am very impressed
thus far. Although it it built upon RedHat ,I am much happier with
Mandrake..  It did seem a liitle slower to install than RedHat os maybe
it was just me, I do have a RH 6 set that I purchased from redhat.I
would not have ever given Mandrake a try before cause I didnt see the
point of a ditrubution based on another existing dist., but I got
Mandrake as a part of the Linux Toolkit from WalnutCreek. So i decided
to give it a try and am I ever glad I did!!!!I hope you much continued
success.
I'll continue use Mandrake as long as there is a current
existing release.

Just needed to write and tell you people that in my opinion L-M has got
to be one the best distributions on the market today. Kudos! on your
winning best product of the year. you deserve it. I started my life in
L-M 5.3 that I purchased with one of those linuxmall bundles, I tried
Red Hat 5.2 and was disappointed, the desktop to me was as cryptic as
the command shell ! there was a delay getting 5.3 so I had to wait a
week, I tried all the distributions in the bundle, slackware, caldera
1.3, debian.....ect. all were not impressive to me....they were Linux.
but not what I expected. getting L-M 5.3 changed all that, it was a
breath of fresh air! I liked it so much that I went out and built a
whole system to run it on, I felt that a distribution this good deserved
a box of it's own! I built a intel 233mhz system whith a 4 gig HD,
Hercules terminator video card,Diamond monster I, 64megs of ram, Awe 64
gold sound card, external u.s. robotics modem (56k) 3c905b nic, 14 in
monitor. reciently I added a removable hard drive enclosure system and
picked up an 8gig HD to use as my "main" OS drive, and I am going to use
my 4gig as my test drive, (to keep from screwing up my perfect running
install) : )
With all the new innovations that you are implementing in the "Cooker"
devel. I cannot wait to see what is in store for ver. 6.1 or are you
just gonna' jump right to 7.0 with your next distribution? oh well, not
imoprtant! also, I am impressed that you are willing to help people with
the GPL version through direct e-mail as well as through your
newsgroups, It seems that I see alot of people with @linux-mandrake.com
answering questions there. most impressive, well, I have to go, I got so
into writing this e-mail that I am gonna' be late for work!!!

this is what makes Linux the best OS out there!

Thanks!

Just for the heck of it I picked up a mandrake box and started installing.
 I'm a Lotus Domino developer and with the beta of DOmino for linux on its
way out I decided I'd grab a new distro box and install dual boot on my
desktop ( I bought the box rather than cable modem DL it mainly cause I
hate writing on them gold CD's and figure why not pay for the stuff that I
have the option not too.)  Now working with notes for years always under
NT I've had to do about 30 or 40 NT installs either server or workstation.
 I was blown clean off my feet with how simple and quick the madrake
install was.  I'm pretty sure I could install a whole 30 workstation
office with mandrake SMB print Services and all those goodies in the time
I could install 1 copy of NT server and one copy of win 95.  The conly
hitch was that the network configing was a bit to easy.

This caused me to spend 10 minutes dicking around with ifconfig when I
didn;t need too.   Oh and I cant figure out how to get that menu back that
lets me choose my windowmanager.  KDE is a little too much like what I am
running away from. :)

J. C.

Keep up the good work oh yeah and can I get an option on the IPO now.

I wanted to thank you guys for all the hard work you have put into Mandrake.
I burned the .iso and installed it with no real problems (I did have to
partition the drive in fdisk as the installer beta for windows did not work
for me).  Afterwards it booted right up and worked just fine.  I am a real
newbie to linux!  Never touched the os before your distro. 
I heard people on irc crying about problem after problem with installations
and running of other disrtos and I sit there saying "huh?  I didn't have
that at all." 
I realized then I had never seen anyone from a Mandrake distro begging for
help and I was one of them!  Thanks again for making Linux pain-free!

Hey peeps,

I think mandrake is by far the coolest distribution of Linux I had ever
seen and of course linux is the best os I have ever seen. So that makes
mandrake the best OS ever.

I've been using linux for about 5 years and have been using unix for about
7 years and I dont think anything comes close to mandrake. I use very
expensive sun machines at work, but I personally believe they should all
behave like mandrake.

How can I get involved in mandrake marketing and letting more people know
about this waycool version of linux? I wanna help out. lemme know.

I am a new user of Linux and I'm learning alot from it everyday.  I just
want to say 2 words to you:
THANK YOU!!! Thank you for being the alternative Operating System of
choice!!

I am a believer that now believes that we DO NOT need
Windows95,98,2000,NT and whatever  Microsoftcrap chooses to put out on
the market.

We are independent and free now thanks to you.  I wish you and your
business partners and all your families a millennium of continued
success and happiness.  I know I am!!
