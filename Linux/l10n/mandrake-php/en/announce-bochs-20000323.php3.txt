Kevin Lawton is the lead developer of two major software projects which allow users to run Windows programs on their Linux platform. His first project "Bochs" is a portable x86 PC emulator, which runs on most all platforms including Linux/x86 and Linux/PPC. Bochs has been developed in an open "bazaar" style since its inception in 1994 and has involved some few hundred developers. Up to now, Bochs has used a commercial license.

In March 1999, Kevin founded the FreeMWare project now known as « Plex86 », an open source alternative to the commercial software from VMware(TM).  Plex86 quickly attracted the attention of many users in search of an open source and high-performance way to run Windows applications on Linux and other operating systems.  There are over 300 interested people on the developer's list. Development of Plex86 is progressing rapidly, drawing from 6 years of work and a large code base intersect with the Bochs project.

"MandrakeSoft recognizes the value brought to our Linux users, by offering them an open source way to concurrently run Windows or other PC operating systems.  We have purchased the Bochs PC emulator, and committed it to open source.  It is a great pleasure to have Kevin as part of our team, and to support the development of these great projects", said Jacques Le Marois, President of MandrakeSoft.

"I can't tell you how happy I am to be working for MandrakeSoft. They really stepped up to the plate for open source.  It's a pleasure to be working with a very progressive team.  Great distro! These guys are the ones to watch", said Kevin Lawton.

Since Bochs has just been commited to an Open-Source license (LGPL), the Plex86 project can now benefit from source code already implemented in Bochs. This will speed up the Plex86 development.
