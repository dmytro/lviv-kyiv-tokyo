<? include("begin3.php3"); ?>

MandrakeSoft, the company behind the popular Linux-Mandrake Linux distribution will finance David Faure, core-developer at KDE to work for the KOffice and KDE projects.
<p>
For Gaël Duval, co-founder of Mandrakesoft, "Mandrake owes a lot of its success to KDE and Free Software movement. We are very happy to help back and contribute to the enhancement of development. We invite all the companies who profit from Open Source Software to support KOffice by funding dedicated developers. The more good developers will be involved in KOffice the faster it will be ready for the users."

It currently includes a enhanced wordprocessor with desktop publishing functionality , a spreadsheet, a presentation application, a vector drawing program, a diagram program, a formula editor and an image viewer. KOffice makes use of the most advanced Object Model in the OSS world. Thanks to this, it is possible to embed any KOffice component in a different KOffice application. This is realized using the KOM/OpenParts object model. Of course the KOffice is, as the whole KDE project, a free project which is released under the GNU GPL.
<p>
David Faure has been a core developer for the KDE project for two years, maintainer of the KDE file manager (kfm) and its rewrite, OpenParts-based (konqueror). He has also participated in the development of the KDE libraries, including KOM/OpenParts, as well as the development of KOffice itself.
