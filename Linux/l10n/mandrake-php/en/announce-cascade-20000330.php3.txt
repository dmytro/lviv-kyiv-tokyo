<b>Paris, France - March 30, 2000</b> - As a first step in a global partnership, Matra Datavision and MandrakeSoft, two European Open
Source pioneers, have announced a technical agreement involving Open CASCADE, the set of Open Source C++ components for 3D
applications, and Linux-Mandrake, one of the most popular distributions of Linux worldwide.
<p align="justify">
Under the terms of this agreement, Open CASCADE supports the Linux-Mandrake Operating System as its preferred Linux platform; Open
CASCADE is referenced by MandrakeSoft as the solution provider for developing specific 3D modeling applications on
Linux-Mandrake.
<p align="justify">
The purpose of this partnership is to offer developers of technical and scientific graphic applications a complete solution for
developing their applications on Linux using market-tested Open Source modeling components. This suite offers an excellent cost
effective and highly flexible alternative to proprietary modeling kernels.
<p align="justify">
Discussions are under way to extend this partnership in the near future.
<p align="justify">
Says Marc Gainette, Director of the Open CASCADE Department at Matra Datavision: "We believe this partnership is the first step
towards building a Linux for 3D solution which will become a standard tool for developers of Linux-based graphic modeling
applications." Yann de Pontbriand, COO of MandrakeSoft adds: "This agreement is in line with our policy for developing strategic
partnerships in various fields based on our Linux products, this agreement allows us to build a strong partnership with a leading
international industrial participant such as Aerospatiale Matra."
<p align="justify">
MandrakeSoft produces and publishes the Open Source Linux-Mandrake operating system and provides free access to source code
published in accordance with the General Public License (GPL). Several hundred developers throughout the world contribute to the
constant improvement of the product directly over the
Internet. Linux-Mandrake is a complete system with choices of several powerful, pre-configured graphic interfaces (notably the
leaders KDE and Gnome), as well as more than 2000 applications including Netscape Communicator, the StarOffice suite, and the
Apache web server.
<p align="justify">
In a testament to its success, MandrakeSoft received the awards for "Best Product of the Year" and "Best
Linux-Distribution/Server" at LinuxWorld Expo 1999. The company has signed a strategic partnership with the American publisher
MacMillan and a distribution agreement with Kasper.  In the months of July and August 1999, Linux-MandrakeSoft held the number one
spot for Linux sales in all of North American with the MacMillan Edition.
<p align="justify">
"Born on the Internet", MandrakeSoft established its headquarters in Paris, France and maintains offices in the United States.
