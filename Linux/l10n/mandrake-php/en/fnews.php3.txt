<b>august 20 1999 -</b> <b>Linux Mandrake open development version available online and through resellers.</b> Linux Mandrake is proud to announce the availability of it's new development version code-named <a href="/en/cookerdevel.php3">"Cooker"</a>. 
<!--/fast-->
What sets the distribution apart
from previous versions is that Linux Mandrake has now adopted a new open
style of development that allows real-time updating of the distribution
based on the contribution of both it's dedicated staff and the user
base. This is in accordance to the "bazaar" style of development
popularized by ESR in his landmark essay "The Cathedral and the Bazaar",
and will help Linux Mandrake better serve the Open Source community.
<p>
Linux Mandrake Cooker is aimed at the following audiences:<p>
<blockquote>
<li> Users who want to stay on the cutting edge with a distribution that is
  updated daily.<br>
<li> Users who want an easier way to upgrade their existing software.<br>
<li> Developers who want to contribute to the development and direction of
  Linux Mandrake.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
Cooker is now available online at:
<a href="/en/cookerdevel.php3">http://www.linux-mandrake.com/cooker</a>
<p>
For those without high-speed internet access we also have several on-line
resellers who can create Cooker CD's on demand with the latest package
upgrades.

<b>March 15 1999 - BeroLinux joins Linux-Mandrake.</b><p>
Hello,
<p>
we - Gaël Duval from the Linux-Mandrake project and Bernhard Rosenkränzer from the new BeroLinux project - are very pleased to announce that we have decided to merge the two projects because we have similar goals and products. 
<!--/fast-->
<p>
We want to make the best Linux distribution for the beginner, we want to be 100% compatible with Red Hat Linux and Un|x configuration standards, we want it easy-to-use: we want to put Linux on the desktop!
<p>
Bernhard Rosenkränzer will now be employed at MandrakeSoft - the company which produces Linux-Mandrake - and be responsible for the official Linux-Mandrake distribution. The new resulting distribution will integrate the new ideas and features from BeroLinux as well as all the new stuff that is actually developped by the Linux-Mandrake team. 
<p>
For example, in the next release, our users will have the choice between both KDE and Gnome for the desktop manager, with new nice interoperability features. They will also be given the possibility to get special optimized version for their hardware too (Pentium I/II, K6...).
<p>
We last plan to integrate some nice features like full 2.2.x kernel support, Euro support, scalable fonts support etc.
<p>
Last but not least, we plan to open the Linux-Mandrake development so that users can contribute and decide what they want for their Linux distribution. Expect more details by the end of the week.
