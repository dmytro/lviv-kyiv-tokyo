<b>November 18, 1999 - MandrakeSoft names Jean-Loup Gailly as CTO.</b>
<p>
MandrakeSoft is very proud to announce the arrival of Jean-Loup Gailly who was named as Chief Technical Officer.
<p> Jean-Loup has been a long time contributor of open source software and
is the co-author of the key compression tools Zip, Gzip and Zlib. Zip and the Info-Zip project is one of the very first true "bazaar" style development projects on the net, combining the talents of programmers from all over the globe.
Info-Zip precedes Linux itself and many other similar development
efforts by at least a couple of years. Gzip is the GNU data compression
utility for the GNU project and is widely used in the Unix world
directly or with Tar, the tape archiver utility. Zlib is one of the most widely used
open source library. Practically every programmer has encountered it at
some point.
<p>
Additionnaly, Jean-Loup Gailly was a member of the team who specified
the
Ada programming language designed for highly-reliable software systems.
Gailly was also responsible for the real-time executive of the Chorus
micro-kernel "a highly scalable and reliable embedded operating system,
that has established itself among top telecom suppliers" (acquired
lately by Sun in 1997)

<p>
Jean-Loup will be responsible for the production of the Linux-Mandrake distribution and will manage 30 MandrakeSoft programmers and the hundreds of contributors who work on Mandrake.
<p>
"We are very honored that Jean-Loup accepted to join us in our project of making Linux available for the masses", said Jacques Le Marois, President of MandrakeSoft.
<p>
"It's a pleasure to be employed by a company that is so devoted to open-source and has a very high potential on the Linux market in the coming years", said Jean-Loup Gailly.
