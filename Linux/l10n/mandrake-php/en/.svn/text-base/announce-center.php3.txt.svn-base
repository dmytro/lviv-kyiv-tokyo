    Pacoima, CA - March 15, 2000 - MandrakeSoft, the publisher of the powerful and
    user-friendly Linux-Mandrake operating system, announced that it will donate the
    software and technical expertise to set up a Linux-based Internet access center in the Los
    Angeles community of Pacoima. In addition to providing the web and e-mail servers for the
    Pacoima Community Technology Center, MandrakeSoft will be connecting the equipment.
    The Technology Center, which celebrates its grand opening on March 30th, aims to provide
    access to computers and the Internet for citizens who would otherwise lack that access. 
<p align="justify">
    The Pacoima project is a collaborative effort between Los Angeles Urban Founders, a
    consortium of philanthropists and foundations, the Los Angeles Unified School District, the
    U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Maxspeed, and MandrakeSoft. The
    Center will provide after-school activities for children, adult education/literacy, career
    development, small-business activities, home access to computers and the Internet, and
    an information clearinghouse for local events. 
<p align="justify">
    Daniel Morales, Chief Operation Officer for MandrakeSoft, has long been active in planning
    the Pacoima Center. "MandrakeSoft recognizes the importance of giving back to our
    communities," said Morales, "We are confident that our award-winning Linux-Mandrake
    operating system will be of great benefit to people of Pacoima."
