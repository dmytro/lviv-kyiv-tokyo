   The Linux-Mandrake team is pleased to announce the
   http://www.linuxi18n.org/ project. 
<p>
   This is a new project to provide a central point of contact between
   programmers/project teams of free software, and translators/translation
   teams. 
<p>
   You may wonder why yet another project, there are already such
   projects for such and such language, or such and such
   program/desktop. But, while they are very important and surely fulfill
   correctly their tasks, the scope isn't the same. 
<p>
   This project aims to be a central point for all possible free programs; it
   could eventually serve as an intermediary to already constitued projects
   or translation teams; but it would also allow the participation of
   individuals, of little known free programs, etc. 
<p>
   Free softwares give, among other good things, the freedom to adapt a
   program to the needs and customs of any culture and language of the
   world; the tools to add the needed support for full translation to
   programs are there; as well as the willing of a lot of potential translators. 
<p>
   But very often, with the exception of 2 or 3 big projects, there is a lack of
   coordination, or a lack of knowledge on how to use those tools by the
   programmers, or the translators don't know how or when to send new
   updated versions of the localized texts, or some individuals want to
   participate but are stopped by the complexity to having to get a full CVS
   tree and compile the programs regularly, or a little free program isn't
   very known and some translation teams never heard of it and is never
   translated,... 

   This project aims to address those problems, by creating a "translation
   bazaar", where the texts to translate can be proposed, people interested
   in doing the translation can pick them and send them back; by
   automatizing most of the work and taking the burden of coordination
   away of programmers and translators. 
<p>
   By my own experience and contact with various programmers and
   translators I can say that such a service is currently really needed; but
   only very big projects like KDE or Gnome can afford to have a similar
   service; and indeed it is seeing the KDE and Gnome pages that I had
   this idea, but this time open to all free projects and programs.
