<p>
<img src="../images/lwec.gif" alt="LinuxWorld Award" align="left">Arkeia is a high-performance network based backup and restore system
that runs on all of the major Unix platforms, (SUN, HP, SGI, AIX...),
as well as VMS, WinNT, Win95, Novell and OS/2.  It is capable of
backing up, an unlimited number of clients, up to, 200 at the same
time.  As soon as 1 of the original clients completes, the next client
is started.  On the tape drive side, Arkeia intelligently multiplexes
the data across, up to, 32 devices simultaneously.
The data is placed on the tapes in such a way that recovery speed is maximized.
<p>
The system is designed for centralized operation with remote control.
Each backup server can be accessed from any client that has the user
interface loaded.  This, password controlled access, lets the system
administrator manage the backup server from any machine on the network.
You can even dial-in from a remote location and perform backup and
restore operations. Only control information is communicated to the
client machine.  There is no X traffic over the network when the remote
machine is an X server.  A JAVA based user interface is also available
for WinNT and Win95 clients.
