ASL, the second largest Linux hardware-solutions provider, has announced
today its decision to adopt Linux-Mandrake after 5 years of using Red Hat. The
decision was based on the overall superiority of the Linux-Mandrake
distribution, specifically in the areas of hardware performance.
<p align="justify">
"Linux-Mandrake is an extremely high quality distribution. But most of all,
Linux-Mandrake delivers the performance that clearly distinguishes itself from
the rest of the Linux distributions. With pentium-optimizations, our
applications have shown speed improvements up to 30%. Linux-Mandrake is
clearly the perfect Linux distribution for ASL high performance workstations
and servers." said Jeff Nguyen, President & CEO of ASL Inc. He also said
"with its high degree of compatibility, the transition to Linux-Mandrake is
very smooth and easy." 
<p align="justify">
This is a major step in large-scale deployments of Linux-Mandrake. We are
very excited to have reached the point where our product is considered the
best choice for ease of use and also for its performance advantages.
<p align="justify">
Linux-Mandrake is the only major Linux distribution optimized for
Pentium processors. In addition to standard performance increases
between 15% and 30%, recent studies show that depending on the processor used
and the flags specified when compiling software under Linux-Mandrake,
speed gains of up to 1150% are possible. Complete results will be published
soon.
