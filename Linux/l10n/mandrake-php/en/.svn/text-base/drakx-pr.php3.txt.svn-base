              <b>DrakX, The Graphical Installation of Linux-Mandrake Now Available<br>
              Mon, 23 Aug 1999 09:09:06am</b>
<p>
              PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 23, 1999--MandrakeSoft, the company behind the
              popular Linux-Mandrake operating system distribution, released today a beta version of its
              graphical installation for Linux-Mandrake, DrakX, for a complete and easy installation of Linux. 
<p>
              As all MandrakeSoft products, DrakX is 100% open source and has already been installed in
              the <a href="/cooker">Mandrake Cooker</a>, the development version of Linux-Mandrake where Linux developers can
              contribute. DrakX is entirely written in Perl which is interface independent, offering contributors
              an easy and flexible way to contribute. This beta version features the integration of Diskdrake, a
              complete hard-drive partitioning tool, that offers users a simple graphic tool for completing the
              painful partitioning phase while installing Linux. 
<p>
              MandrakeSoft maintains Red Hat compatibility and the well-proven Red Hat installation to provide
              its users a choice. DrakX enables users to install Linux-Mandrake per CDRom or network,
              and counts several use-levels to allow new comer, as well as hackers to easily install Linux.
              DrakX also implemented a new powerful kickstart mode from Red Hat that enables users to
              quickly install Linux on several identical machines. DrakX has been designed to be the fastest
              easiest to use, and more powerful graphical installation in the Linux market. 
<p>
              Daniel Morales, CEO, MandrakeSoft says, "DrakX dramatically increases the Linux installation
              process and is the first graphical installation combined with an open source Linux partitioning tool.
              We are immediately releasing a beta version of DrakX so that Linux developers may improve it
              since we owe much of our product success to the contributions of the Linux community. Their
              development efforts are continuously improving Linux-Mandrake existing features and creating
              new ones. This evolution process is key to Linux users and allows us to maintain our competitive
              leadership." 
<p>
