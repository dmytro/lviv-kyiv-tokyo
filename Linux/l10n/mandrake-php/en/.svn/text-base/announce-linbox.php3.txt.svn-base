<b>February 14 2000 - SuSE Linux AG, MandrakeSoft and Linbox Inc. Join Forces to Develop Linux Network Computing</b>
<p align="justify">
NUREMBERG, Germany, PASADENA, USA and METZ, France - 2/14/2000 - SuSE
Linux AG, MandrakeSoft and Linbox Inc. are joining forces to develop
Linux Network Computing and bring it to the broadest audience. SuSE Linux
AG, MandrakeSoft and Linbox Inc. are partnering to develop and include in
future versions of Linux distributions the key technologies of the Linbox
Network Architecture. All SuSE Linux and MandrakeSoft users will soon be
able to set up efficient diskless Network Computing solutions based on
Linux.
<p align="justify">
The Linbox Network Architecture is an open approach to Linux Network
Computing based on diskless standard computers on the desktop side, such
as the Linbox Net Station, and full featured servers, such as the Linbox
Net Server. According to Jean Pierre Laisne', CEO of Linbox Inc., "The
Linbox Network Architecture allows users to bring the power of Linux to
the desktop at minimal costs while still preserving the user's investments
in Windows or MacOS software. Diskless Linbox Net Stations can be set up
in a matter of minutes by users with no previous skills in the Linux
environment and require no maintenance."
<p align="justify">
Roland Dyroff, CEO of SuSE Linux AG adds, "We have been impressed by the
implementation of the Linbox Network Architecture in the school of Saint
Die' (France). After 6 months, it appears that 6 year old pupils can
effectively use Internet and Productivity software under Linux and, at
the same time, access legacy multimedia CD-ROMs for Windows. We have
decided to partner with Linbox and MandrakeSoft so that all Linux users
worldwide will be able to benefit from Linux Network Computing and the
Linbox Network Architecture with minimal effort."
<p align="justify">
"MandrakeSoft will actively join SuSE Linux AG and Linbox Inc. in this
standardization effort," says Jacques Le Marois, President of
MandrakeSoft. "The LNA can be implemented very easily on any standard
hardware platform without any restrictions. LNA brings to the community
the kind a freedom one would expect for Linux Network Computing."
<p align="justify">
Under the joint partnership, SuSE Linux AG, MandrakeSoft and Linbox will
form an open project which will publish the specifications of the Linbox
Network Architecture and the required software under open source
licensing. Development will be held by the Linbox R&D center in the
Lorraine region, France's pioneering region for Linux and Free Software.
All Linux users and businesses are welcome to join the LNA open project.
