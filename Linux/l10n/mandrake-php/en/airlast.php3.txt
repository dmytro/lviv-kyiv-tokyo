<b>Autoboot users</b>
<br><i>what:</i> can't load second stage ramdisk, or can't exec stage2
<br><i>when:</i> before starting the X graphical install, after finding the cdrom

<p>
<b>PCMCIA pcnet_cs</b>
<br><i>what:</i> can't find the module 8390.o

<br><i>solution:</i> use this <a href="/drakx/patches/pcmcia.img">pcmcia.img</a> floppy image
<p>
<b>RAID mylex DAC:</b>

<br><i>when:</i> at step `setup SCSI'
<br><i>solution:</i> use this <a href="/drakx/patches/dac960/patch.pl">patch</a>
<p>
<b>USB or serial mouse incorrectly detected</b>
<br><i>what:</i> the mouse was wrongly detected as a PS2 mouse instead of a serial or USB mouse
<br><i>when:</i> at step `select Language'
<br><i>why:</i> the kernel has some problem with some motherboards and detection for serial or USB mice may be incorrect
detects a PS2 mouse is available

<p>
<b>install freeze</b>
<br><i>what:</i> in graphical installation mode, ther is no response at all (num lock doesn't even toggle)
<br><i>when:</i> at step `setup SCSI'
<br><i>why:</i> the kernel has some problem with some motherboards (Shuttle Spacewalker HOT-569 with S3 based video card) and freezes.
<br><i>solution:</i> either install in expert and choose NO pci probe, or use this <a href="/drakx/patches/skippci/patch.pl">patch</a>

<br><i>when:</i> at step `Setup Filesystems', in some instance of a large FAT partition

<br><i>solution:</i> either use this <a href="/drakx/patches/pcitable/patch.pl">patch</a> or choose "expert mode" install and when configuring X, choose "no PCI detection". During graphic card selection choose "Unlisted" and when selecting the X server pick "SVGA".
<p>

<br><i>what:</i> DrakX tries to install module "unknown" and fails
<br><i>when:</i> at step `setup SCSI'

<p>
<b>computer with no PCI:</b>
<br><i>what:</i> can't open /proc/bus/pci/devices
<br><i>when:</i> at step `setup SCSI'
<br><i>solution:</i> use this <a href="/drakx/patches/nopci/patch.pl">patch</a>
<p>
<b>formatting FAT fails:</b>
