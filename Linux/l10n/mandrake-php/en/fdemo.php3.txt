Linux Mandrake Demo

This is not really a Linux-Mandrake demonstration: you would better try Mandrake to make up your mind ;-) Anyway, here are a few things:<p>

- installation-process: there is not much to say about since it's very similar to Red Hat installation procedure. <p>
- login "Linux-Mandrake" the first time: when the installation-process is finished, you can reboot and you see a nice ascii-penguin appearing on your screen :-) (we have thought about lauching Linux in runlevel 5 (Graphics mode) after reboot: it will be available from Mandrake 6.0)<p>
- then log as root and type 'startx'... you should see this appearing:<p>

<p>

- now you have got a full working graphical Linux operating system. You can configure it easily (as root) with Linux-conf (in text, X, or web mode)<p>

- just a few things to know... How to access to your floppy-disks and cd-roms? Do you see the two small icons on the screen?<p>

- please just insert you Linux-mandrake CD in the PC and click on the CDROM icon... Here is what you get:<p>

- yes, it's very easy to mount devices with Linux-Mandrake! Notice that you know when a device is mounted: a green led is higlighted close to the device icon:<p>

- now, just for fun, please drag the "doc" directory entry from the KFM (K File Manager) view and drop it on your desk...<p>

<center><img src="../images/scr-shortcut.gif"></center><p>

- and you get a shortcut to the 'doc' directory on your desktop...<p>

<b>Those were only a few small things: there are many more to discover in Linux-Mandrake!!!</b>
