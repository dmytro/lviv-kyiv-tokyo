<b>Mandrake 6.1pre (Cassini) purposes</b>
<p align=justify>
<img src="../images/bluehat.gif" align=right> The purpose of Cassini is to debug the new Mandrake 6.1 distribution just before its official release. We want to be a rock-solid distribution!
<p align=justify>
 Please subscribe to <b>cassini@linux-mandrake.com</b> [just send an email to
 sympa@linux-mandrake.com with "SUB cassini" without the quotes 
 in the subject of the message] and report and discuss any bug that you will find in the new Mandrake.
<p>
<b>Mandrake 6.1pre (Cassini) main features:</b><p>
Note: all the new features will be announced at official Mandrake 6.1 final release.

<b><u>How to download the beta</u>?
</b>
<p> 
Please use a mirroring tool like <a href="ftp://ftp.pvv.ntnu.no/pub/unix/network/fmirror/">fmirror</a> (<a href="fmirror.tgz">libc6 for Cassini</a>) or wget (wget -rm ftp://ftp.......com/pub/cassini).

<b>How to use fmirror?</b><p>
<blockquote>
<li> install fmirror
<li> make a script called "MirrorCassini" (or other) containing something like (you should replace data in bold with your own settings):<p>
<tt>#!fmirror -f<br>
<p>
username:       ftp<br>
password:     <b>user@mydomain.com</b><br>
host:   <b>themirror.com</b><br>
remotedir:      <b>/path_to_6.1b/</b>6.1b/<br>
localdir:       <b>/usr/local/cassini</b><br>
timefuzz:       1000000000<br>
<p>
exclude:        f       ^(hdlist)                   <br>
</tt>
<p>
<li> make your script executable:<br> <tt>$ chmod 0755 MirrorCassini</tt><br>
<li> run the script:<br><tt>$ MirrorCassini</tt> (should take a long time ;) )<br>
<li> rebuild hdlist: <br><tt>$ /usr/local/cassini/misc/genhdlist /usr/local/cassini</tt><br>
<li> install Cassini - run MirrorCassini from time to time: every modification made to the distribution will be detected and packages automatically replaced by the new ones on your HD.
