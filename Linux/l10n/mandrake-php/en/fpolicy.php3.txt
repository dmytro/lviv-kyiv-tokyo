If you don't know at all about Linux, you might be interested in having a look at our <a href="linux.php3">"What is Linux?"</a> page first.

<p align=justify><b>Linux Mandrake<sup>TM</sup></b> is a complete pre-configured graphical Linux<sup>TM</sup> operating system. It's easy to install, easy to use and stable. And it's available in your own language! When you try it, you adopt it!<p>

Inside <i>Linux Mandrake</i>, the graphical interfaces KDE, Gnome, AfterStep, WindowMaker, IceWM etc. are fully integrated inside a very modern distribution, fully compatible with Red Hat<sup>TM</sup> applications (RPM packages).
