<li><b>BFRIS</b>

                                       Zero Gravity Fighter Combat
      ...Within seconds of activation, thousands of warships begin pouring out of the
alien matter
   transport gate, immediately attacking everything in sight. The construction
facilities and colonies
    on Jupiter's moons are all but destroyed; mining facilites in the Oort cloud are
left a shambles,
                              and the alien warships advance towards Earth.
                                     It is humanity's darkest hour.
    That was nearly a century ago; we are in our 83rd year of war with the alien
invaders. Many among
    our people have given up hope, saying that one person can not make a difference;
our way of life
                             relies upon that one person who does not agree.

* Fly six unique combat fighters and battle with plasma cannons and ten
different powerups in a maze of interconnected battle arenas

Drawn by cartoon specialists according to the rule book they were scanned and
meticulously retouched frame by frame to produce high-quality scenes. A very
special care was taken to realise the game's introduction and final scenes.
(Real size of this animation: 640 * 400 pixels)

Highly detailed, with very studied camera movements, extremely realistic 3D
scenes leading the player by the airs as under the seas give him incomparable
sensations. Fluid full screen SVGA 3D scenes were realised without any
perceptible quality loss by the use of an unique compression algorithm.

Hand draw image
Retouched and colorized image First hand drawn by a famous strip cartoonist,
Thierry Ségur, they were scanned then retouched and coloured on computer by an
international graphist team. They give to the player an uninterrupted pleasure
of discovery, leading him from HOPKINS's apartment to a secret submarine base,

mysterious Condor Island, an hidden universe where the dead can talk, and so

<li><b>UConvert: POSC Universal Units Converter</b>

It is a units conversion program that easily and quickly shows
equivalencies for everything from common units such as feet in a
mile to obscure units such as therms in a joule.

A calculator function is included with the converter to allow
easy conversion from any number of units to the equivalent
number of "other" units.

Units are indexed by categories.  This lets you find all the
valid units for a specific category.  For example, for the
category "frequency," you can easily see the valid units are
cycles/second, Hertz, radians/second and revolutions/minute.
(The converter then lets you convert any of these units to any
of the other units.)

The POSC Universal Units Converter is based on POSC standard
reference data for units conversion.  It comes preloaded with
the current units reference data as defined in the POSC
Specifications V2.2.2.  Using a menu option of the program, a
user connected to the Internet may request the latest available
reference data to be downloaded from the POSC web site at any
time.
