ENGLISH-RUSSIAN Fonts
Version 4.00
(c) 1995, Gavin Helf

NOTICE: Although these fonts are called "English-Russian," they fully support other
        cyrillic slavic languages (Ukrainian, Belorussian, Serbian, Macedonian, etc).
	"ER" has become something of a trademark name for my fonts, so I'll stick with
	it.  I take no responsibility if this software screws you over. 
	===USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!===

Installation: These files contain TrueType .TTF font files.  Pick the fonts you want, 
	      and use CONTROL PANEL | FONTS to install them.  The file ERFONTS.WRI 
              will display all the fonts that you have installed.

Parsing the File Names:

BK*.ZIP	        "Bukinist"  -  serif font (true itl/bld).

About Keyboards: To use your Cyrillic characters, you need a keyboard driver.  One
option is the my WINKEY program, which will let you switch in both DOS and Windows,
as well as modify your system fonts to display cyrillic.  Look for WINKEY.ZIP in
the nearest future.
